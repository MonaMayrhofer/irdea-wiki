# [Irdea-Wiki](https://monamayrhofer.github.io/irdea-wiki/)
Sources for Mona's [Irdea-Wiki](https://monamayrhofer.github.io/irdea-wiki/) - a compendium about the fantasy world "Irdea", created for the [Pathfinder](https://paizo.com/pathfinder) roleplaying system.

Currently this public interface is extremely incomplete and barely usable, it is not yet intended as a general reference for players and more a collection of random pages
that I wanted to give my players at some point.
