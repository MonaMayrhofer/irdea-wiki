Rune Circle Locks were among the most common arcane locks in the time of 5800 and before, after which Gishel Von Dreick invented the much more versatile "Arcane Cryptonic Diffusion Locks". However due to the extremely stable nature of the classical Rune Circle Locks they are still often used in circumstances where the longevity of the lock is more important than usability or discretion. If the arcane flow around the intended place of usage is unstable or the persistence of the lock is of such importance, that it may not fail under any circumstances, the more modern cryptonic diffusion locks are usually deemed too insecure or unstable and Circle Locks are used, as they can effectively function even without the presence of a strong magical flow, due to their passive arcane nature.

Rune Circle locks are concentric circles of rune-complexes, split up into sectors - forming roughly trapezoid (though as they lie on a circle, they are distorted) sections that are usually referred to as *Knots*. To unlock the circle these knots have to be activated (e.g via the pressing of a button or supplying of magical energy, depending on the physical construction of the lock) in the correct order, which will activate the underlying *Collocation Construct* resulting in the performance of a spell - usually the suppression of abjuration magic that was put in place to keep e.g a door shut. It is also possible to create *Collocation Constructs* that also perform a spell after an erroneous sequence of activation, like triggering an alarm or - in extreme security cases - evoking an effect to destroy the possible intruder. However as Rune Circle locks are passive in nature, these secondary effects cannot be performed arbitrarily often - as at some point the arcane reservoir is depleted and the lock will need to recharge.

# 1 Concept behind Rune Circle Locks

  + A rune-line is threaded from the center through each of the knots. Within each knot the line forms a complicated rune-complex that - when this knot is activated - modifies the signature of the rune-line in a very particular way. After the line passed through every knot it is threaded to the *Collocation Construct*, which verifies the signature of the line and then performs some preset arcane effect - like opening a door.

# 2 Structure of Rune Circle Locks

  + The number of Circles within a lock represents the *Antakian Grade* - where the *Antako Rank* is usually used to describe which circle a rune-complex belongs to. These ranks are numbered from the center outwards - where the center itself is usually referred to as having a Zero-Rank.

  + Each lock has a defined orientation along which its *Santor* field increases in strength.

  + The arcane threading direction - usually referred to as *Alwan* describes in which direction the underlying arcane lines were created.

# 3 Creating Rune Circle Locks

  + Sidenote: To ease the construction of high-folded Rune Circle Locks the works of Olisha Tendali on obfuscating arcane Signatures in her work "Discombobulation of Discrete DAL-Circles" can be employed to merge the Nie-4 connexals of seperate rune-complexes. This - or the much more complicated "Discretized Alnfabric Interweaving" method are the only known ways of creating locks where no rune-complex is less than two-fold. As the "DAI" method can only yield odd-folded complexes it would break the symmetry on many locks, that have an even number of sectors and circles, it is therefore less common. [...]

  + As the keen locksmith might already have discerned so far, the most difficult parts of the obfuscation of a lock are always the first and last activation. In fact the only way to incorporate the signature of the rune-complex, which marks the begin of the activation sequence into that of a two or more fold rune-complex is to weave its DAL-Lines into that of the rune-complex that has to be activated last. We have to keep in mind, that due to the limitations in DAL-Density being able to reach the first from the last complex can indeed pose a serious problem. On circles where the last symbol lies on a complex which is less than eight-fold we can only reach complexes that are max-1-conductive, if it lies on a complex which is less than six-fold we can only reach complexes that are max-0-conductive and if it lies on a two-fold complex we can only reach *Alwanese Twins* or *Alwanese Conjugates*. This - combined with the problem of DAL-complementarity, which we touched on above - makes the construction of small locks quite tricky and has led to [...]

# 4 Deciphering Rune Circle Locks

  + Deciphering a rune circle lock is a difficult task. It first involves the correct classification of the direction of *Alwan* and *Santor*, then classifying the *rune-complexes* of each *Knot* as fine grained as possible and at last extracting as many constraints from the *Collocation Circuit* as possible and at last the reconstruction of the original rune-line - thus learning the correct sequence of activations for this lock.

  + While schools usually teach Circles that have a clockwise *Alwan*, in theory there is nothing preventing a circle with counter-clockwise *Alwan*. Thus it is of necessity to confirm your initial guess regarding the *Alwanian Direction*, e.g through Arcane Inductometry via a pendulum or similar means. The direction of *Alwan* is most often determined by the direction of the shorter distance of the first symbol towards the last symbol that have to be activated - these are always either *alwanese* or *alwanese conjugates*. Therefore correctly identifying the *Alwan* of the lock already supplies some information towards the correct sequence.

  + Many students are of the mistaken belief, that the *Santor* always increases from bottom to top - as this is how it is usually taught in schools - however there is nothing preventing you from rotating the lock however you want - so it has to be determined via Processes like Heron Takanagi's Arcane Aurean Introspection or similar processes.

  + Usually each *Knot* is occupied by a singular rune-complex - tho expert lockmages can create multidimensional locks, with more than one. Identifying the type of the *rune-complex* of each *Knot* is essential to be able to decipher the correct code.

  + As *rune-complexes* are an emergent rune-like behavior of the underlying arcane lines, which are made up of actual runes, they cannot be classified as easily as runes - therefore trying to list them all here would be futile. When building a lock (See chapter 3.7) usually the type of the *rune-complex* follows immediately from the target sequence and the arrangement of adjancent knots - as their arcane ablongations have to fit neatly into each other, to ensure the stability of the lock. It is however very desirable to create highly symmetrical locks, where all of the knots seem similar, as then the deciphering of the underlying *Collocation construct* will be nearly impossible - even if the individual rule-signatures from the *Collocation constructs* are successfully extracted.
  + Identifying a *rune-complex* is usually done using traditional methods of identifying rune-lines and arcane magic.

  + If two *rune-complexes* are  too similar to reliably differentiate between them - they are usually assumed equal. In lock deciphering jargon this phenomenon is referred to as *foldedness* - so a "threefold rune-complex" in reality describes three distinct rune-complexes, that are so similar, that they are treated as equal when trying to reconstruct the sequence of activations from the *Collocation Circuit*. If a lock with m circles and n sectors can only be classified with a m * n-fold complex it is referred to as a a *(near) perfect lock*. The lock which seals the legendary vault beneath the Society of the Golden Sun is one of the few known near perfect locks that were ever crafted.

  + Extracting the rules of the *Collocation Construct* is usually done via Aermet's Excite and Response Method - tho a lot of care has to be taken, not accidentally supplying too high of an exciting force and therefore triggering possible secondary effects, like an alarm or more drastic evocations. After some experimentation (See more in Chapter 4.8) it should become clear which Responses of the CC are positive and negative. After identifying that, it is time to supply excitation forces that would correspond to possible activations of some of the knots - details on interpreting the responses can be found in Chatper 4.9. Depending of the complexity of the lock and foldedness of its rune-complexes more or less constraints need to be extracted this way, to get a definite solution in the next step.

  + Having extracted as many constraints as possible, it is now time to try to reconstruct the route of the underlying rune-line and therefore the correct sequence of activations. This step is simple logic  - however there exist devices like "Pareli's Think Thing" can be used to automate this reasoning.

  + After it is open - it is important to prevent it from closing, as usually there are mechanisms in place that will very fiercely shut it again.

  + ## 4.10 Typical Results of Armet's EaR Method

    + In Lock Deciphering we often come across similar extracted constraints, and therefore some jargon exists

    + **Antakian Twins** Two activations are "Antakian Twins" if they have the same *Antako*

    + **Alwanese Twins** Two activations are "Alwanese Twins" if they have the same *Alwan*, so they lie within the same sector.

    + **Alwanian Distance** The "Alwanian Distance" between two activations, describes the lowest number of sectors lie in between the two activations.

    + **min (max) k conductive** The shortest path between two activations passes through at least (most) k other knots.

    + **Alwanese** Two activations are "Alwanese" if the *Alwanian Distance* from the one that has to be activated earlier to the one that has to be activated later follow the direction of *Alwan* and they are not *Alwanese conjugates*

    + **Alwanese Conjugates** Two activations are "Alwanese Conjugates" if they are seperated by the maximum possible *Alwanian Distance*

    + **Antakian Conjugates** Two activations are "Antakian Conjugates" if they are *Antakian Twins* and also *Alwanese Conjugate*.

    + first **follows** second: Two rune-complexes are said to "(immediately) follow" each other, if an activation of the second rune-complex requires an activation of the first rune-complex later in the series. If they "immediately follow" the activation to the first rune-complex has to be immediately after the activation to the second rune-complex.

    + **increases Santor** An activation is said to "increase Santor" if the center of the knot lies within stronger Santor then the one before it.
