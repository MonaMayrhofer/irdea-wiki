However due to the extremely stable nature of the classical Rune Circle Locks they are still often used in circumstances where the longevity of the lock is more important than usability or discretion. If the arcane flow around the intended place of usage is unstable or the persistence of the lock is of such importance, that it may not fail under any circumstances, the more modern cryptonic diffusion locks are usually deemed too insecure or unstable and Circle Locks are used, as they can effectively function even without the presence of a strong magical flow, due to their passive arcane nature.</description></item></channel></rss>
